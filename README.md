Practice is published in here for each week. 

You use both a Mac running Xcode and an iPad to run a playground book. You download the Swift Playgrounds Author Template and open it in Xcode on a Mac. You then write pages for the book and package up all of its resources into a .playgroundbook file that you share with an iPad.
